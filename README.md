# Invisible Light Webpage

A React + Vite single-page experience that explores invisible light and how scientists harness wavelengths beyond human vision. The site includes animated sections, a self-made 3D spectrum visual, cultural and historical context, and MLA-formatted citations.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the listed local URL to view the page. Any edits in `src/` trigger hot reloads.

## Key Features

- Scroll-triggered animations built with `framer-motion`
- Three-dimensional invisible light visual crafted with `three` and `@react-three/fiber`
- Sections covering phenomenon description, applications, history (1800s–2020s), photon physics, and case studies
- MLA citations sourced from reputable scientific organizations
- Spectrum-inspired theme and responsive layout

## Self-Made Visual

All diagrams and visual components—including the 3D electromagnetic wave—are designed within the project to satisfy the “self-made visual” requirement. External images are not used; referenced experiments and missions are credited in the citations section.
